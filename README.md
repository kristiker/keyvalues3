## keyvalues3
KeyValues3 is a Valve developed data format. It is similar in structure to JSON, but supports binary encodings, versioning, and data annotations. The text syntax also has some minor ergonomic improvements (support for single- and multi-line comments, trailing commas, and multi-line strings.)
